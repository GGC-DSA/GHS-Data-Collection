# GHS-Data-Collection
Green and Healthy Schools - Data Collection Project

## Project Description 
Students carry out the project, collecting photos, videos, stories, and participation data to GHS. The project requires the creation of a dashboard for easy search and viewing of all submitted projects. The data should be stored in a searchable database, and a user-friendly submission form needs to be developed for teachers.
