## Project Description

Students have engineered a user-friendly web interface, facilitating educators in seamlessly inputting data regarding their school's environmental footprint and initiatives. This comprehensive database encompasses narratives, photographs, videos, and participation records. It serves as a centralized repository for information on energy utilization, waste handling, water consumption, carbon footprint, and an array of eco-friendly endeavors such as recycling programs, composting initiatives, sustainability campaigns, and outdoor educational ventures. Furthermore, a dynamic dashboard has been integrated to present statistical analyses, enabling accurate presentation to the district board and stakeholders.
